        the LeakCanary will be able to catch the memory leak in the code (Be patient, it takes some
        time for leakCanary to find out the memory leak). The solutions are also provided in
        the code (commented out). Once you understand the code, replace the bad codes with right codes.
        You will find out that the memory leak problems are gone.</string>
